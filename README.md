This program simulates multidimensional space-fractional Brusselator problem with homogenous Neumann boundary conditions. The program uses the matrix transfer technique and a linearly implict predictor-corrector methods.
The project consists of several functions that are in the ./TestFunction Directory as well three other directories for the three simulations in one-, two- and three- dimensions.
The user will need change the third and fourth line  in the makefiles to directories the user wish to use.
